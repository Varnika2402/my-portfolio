Welcome to my personal portfolio website, designed and developed using only HTML and CSS. This project reflects my dedication to clean, structured design and my enthusiasm for front-end development. Every section — from layout to typography — was carefully crafted to create a bold, engaging, and user-friendly experience. The projects featured here are deeply rooted in my personal interests, which made the development process both meaningful and enjoyable. I focused on thoughtful design elements such as consistent alignment, intuitive navigation, and visually appealing styling to ensure a seamless browsing experience. This portfolio not only showcases my technical skills but also represents my creativity, attention to detail, and commitment to building visually expressive web experiences. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.
